  <h2>NO ONE CAN BELIEVE!</h2>
  <p><img class='rightimg' src='imgsaed/city.png'  > Manchester City and Real Madrid played an all-time Champions League classic on Tuesday,
  with Pep Guardiola's side taking home a 4-3 win in the semifinal first leg. The English side were dominant at times, 
  but their relentless opponents fought back time and time again to leave the tie open ahead of next Wednesday's second leg in Madrid. 
  Six different players scored on the night, the goalkeepers had games they will want to soon forget,
  and so many players stepped up in a match that will be referenced for years to come. you can watch  the matche's goals from <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj1kcRsy7og' target="_blank">here.</a></p>

  <h2>A ONE-SIDE MATCH!</h2>
  <p><img class='rightimg' src='imgsaed/liverbool.png'  > Liverpool have one foot in the Champions League final after beating Villarreal on Wednesday in their semifinal first leg,
  2-0. Similar to their Merseyside derby victory over Everton last weekend, 
  the Reds had the chances to take command early but were just a tad off,
  coming to life in the second half. Fans at Anfield had to wait for nearly an hour of play to see the first goal,
  but it finally came via an own goal from Pervis Estupinan off a cross from Jordan Henderson in the 53rd minute.
  Sadio Mane made it 2-0 just two minutes later thanks to his quick finish off a naughty nutmeg assist from Mohamed Salah.

  <h2>ITALY First Game Of Finals!</h2>
  <p><img class='rightimg' src='imgsaed/VOLLEY.png'  > After 5 sets and two hours and 19 minutes of a play, No.2 Cucine Lube Civitanova beat
  No.1 Sir Safety Conad Perugia in Game 1 of the 2021/22 Italian Men’s Volleyball Championship finals.
  The 2021/22 Superlega Credem Banca finals couldn’t have started in a more spectacular way. 
  Just like in the semi-final series against Leo Shoes PerkinElmer Modena, the home factor lost significance already in Game 1 of the playoff finals, 
  with Lube managing to win the 5-set challenge full of surprises and overturns at PalaBarton. Lube dominated the first and fourth set, 
  Perugia rose in the second and third,so the verdict was postponed to the tie break. In it, Lube squandered 8-4 but still prevailed.
  Cuban Robertlandy Simón finished the match as Lube’s the top scorer with 20 points,
  making 82% attack (14/17). The entrance of Osmany Juantorena (after a long absence from courts) for a few rallies in the second set might be the signal 
  that Gianlorenzo Blengini will employ him more in the coming games of the series. Luxembourger Kamil Rychlicki tallied 14 points for Perugia.S</p>

  <h2>LIAM SMITH PUSHES FOR ANOTHER WORLD TITLE SHOT.</h2>
  <p><img class='rightimg' src='imgsaed/boxing.png'  > Liam Smith signaled his intentions to rule the super-welterweight
  division once again by becoming the first man to stop Jessie Vargas in chief support of Katie Taylor vs.  Amanda Serrano.
Smith got cut in the third round over his right eye. Vargas was cut in the fifth as both men came out firing.
The tide began to turn in Smith’s favor as the halfway mark approached and poured on the pressure.
 He landed heavy artillery on the Vegas man, who somehow stayed on his feet, surviving an incredibly sustained attack in the ninth round.
The referee inspected the former two-weight World champion and deemed him ok to carry on. </p>
